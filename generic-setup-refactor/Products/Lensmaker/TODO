CSL
 Should CSL be BTreeFolder? Can those be ordered? Do we need ordering of CSL?

Entry
 Probably need a TagsWidget that understands space separated entries instead of normal LinesField
 set id to contentId

Tool

Skins:
 lens_view behavior on empty: need 'found' like Yummy endorsementsBy?
 lens_view still needs tags/comments displayed in content

 changing image leaves old image still in browser cache; we might try a nocache header somewhere.

content_render
  i18n of attributes
  secondary lens listing should not show endorsements/associated
  what's on the other side of tags? another content view? a list of lenses?
  courses still need duplication of view and add functions
     - but this is low on the list until UI shakes out, since it will require duplicated changes
