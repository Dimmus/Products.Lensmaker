Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    >>> from Products.Lensmaker.browser.interfaces import IAfterTransitionEvent
    >>> from Products.Lensmaker.events import AfterTransitionEvent
    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
    >>> verifyClass(IAfterTransitionEvent, AfterTransitionEvent)
    True

    >>> from Products.Lensmaker.FavoritesLens import FavoritesLens
    >>> FavoritesLens.archetype_name == 'Favorites Lens'
    True
    >>> FavoritesLens.content_icon == 'star.png'
    True
